 This is a how to use guide for this program.

 The most basic description of this program is that it will repeat what the user types in the command line.

 The more advanced description is that the program repeats the user input
 using thread creation and "manually created semaphores".
 When the program first runs, it runs on its own main thread.
 Then the program creates a child thread.
 This new child thread is in charge of printing out the user input.
 The user input is happening inside the main thread but the printing
 is happening inside the child thread.

 1. Open a terminal.
 2. Change Directory into Milestone2 folder.
